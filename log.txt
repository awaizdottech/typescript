npm i -d typescript
# using require ignores the type checking
tsc index.ts
node index.js

setting up config file:
npx tsc --init

in config file:
rootDir & outDir allows us to specify wihch folder compiler should look in for any source typescript files we want to compile then which folder to output the compile js code into
then tsc -b
tsc --watch
node --watch filePath

interview questions
no int or float or numbers, just number
interface can be reopend but not type
getters need to have a return value and setters shouldnt, not even void

we can also define all custom data types in a file and use them

.d.ts are declaration files present in node_modules/@types folder that are used to provide type information for any third party library that we are using in our project
// @ts-ignore - comment before a line with type errors to ignore them

npm i @types/node
npm i -D @types/express

# whenever u publish a package written in ts u publish the js files and the declaration files only not the ts files

scripts in package.json for ts
build: tsc -b
start: node dist/index.js
dev: npm run build && npm run start

nodemon behaves differently with ts files, so we need to install ts-node
