npm i -g typescript
tsc index.ts
node index.js

setting up config file:

in config file:
rootDir & outDir allows us to specify wihch folder compiler should look in for any source typescript files we want to compile then which folder to output the compile js code into

interview questions
no int or float or numbers, just number
interface can be reopend but not type
getters need to have a return value and setters shouldnt, not even void

we can also define all custom data types in a file and use them

npm i @types/node
npm i express @types/express
